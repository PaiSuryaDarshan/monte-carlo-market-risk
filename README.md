# Monte Carlo Market Risk Simulation
Monte Carlo framework to model market uncertainty and generate distributional outcomes for prices and returns under varying assumptions. Used scenario analysis to stress-test inputs, examine tail behaviour and downside risk, and assess sensitivity to key parameters, with results framed to support decision-making under uncertainty.
